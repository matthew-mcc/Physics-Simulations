# Physics-Simulations

A collection of mid-level physics simulations from various University classes. All written in python using basic packages.

Most of the parameters of the simulations need to be changed in the actual code files.

# Usage

Update the parameters of the simulation and then simply run the .py file! Happy simulating!
